# NodeProject
Project for server-side programming class

# Instructions
You are to follow along with the tutorial on the node lectures and complete an application for the lectures. 

You can either use the XKCD comic or the NASA api to create a web app that loads and displays the information for the APIs. 

The information being displayed, title, image, description, date, etc, should be properly formatted and use bootstrap to display it. 

The images can come of any size so make sure to try a few different sizes and make sure your container will look good with any of the sizes listed. 

The other thing is we will be deploying these sites. Look at the tutorial for deploying the application so that the website is live.

# Deliverables
- Github for Node + express app
- Website URL for deployed application
